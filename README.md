### Feedback

### fib.py

* Good job finding the error and reverting to the last working version of fib.py
* phi_approx output works well
* phi_converge output file writing works, however the shell output is not correct (it should print to the terminal if no filename is given/it also prints out the 3rd order approximation instead of the approximation at each order as well as the final result)
* To fix this ^ inside the while loop of phi_converge you should have a print statement to the standard output if no filename is given. You write to the file correctly though :)

* Overall great job!
